# Cosmetics-Product-Analysis

Cosmetic Ingredient Analysis and Recommendation System

This project aims to help users choose cosmetic products tailored to their skin type and preferences. Input data, such as ingredient lists, is collected and preprocessed to identify relevant features. The system filters ingredients based on the target skin type (e.g., dry skin) and creates a matrix for analysis. Dimensionality reduction using t-SNE simplifies the data for visualization, which is displayed interactively using Bokeh. Users can explore the visualized data to identify suitable products. Recommendations are generated based on analyzed data patterns. Debugging mechanisms ensure smooth visualization and recommendation processes. The user-friendly system empowers informed decisions, promoting healthier skincare choices.
